## Git Repository Layout
The root directory of the repository contains the `README.md` .

The approach of using Git in this project was to commit changes at any time a new functionality was added. An example would be a task to add functionality for a user. The task would be broken down into sub-tasks and when a sub-task has been implemented, a commit would be added to Git.
