# Web Chat App
This repository contains a real-time web chat application implemented using clearly PHP and JS.

## Status
This application currently holds the following functionality:  

### Users
* Create user
* Identified by username
* Can assign an email address to itself
* Search users

## Git Repository Layout
The root directory of the repository contains the `README.md` .

The approach of using Git in this project was to commit changes at any time a new functionality was added. An example would be a task to add functionality for a user. The task would be broken down into sub-tasks and when a sub-task has been implemented, a commit would be added to Git.  

Ensure that the root directory of the Git repository contains an `images` directory. This directory is where the uploaded images are saved and statically served back to the user.
